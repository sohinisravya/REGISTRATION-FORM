# REGISTRATION-FORM 
Building a User Registration Form with HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB 
In this project, I developed a user registration form using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The form allows users to sign up and store their information in a database. 
Steps I Took:
Designing the Form:
         Created a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and CSS.
         Added form validation to ensure that users enter valid data.
Connecting to MongoDB:
         Set up a MongoDB database to store user information.
         Used Node.js to connect to the database.
Handling Form Submissions:
         Created a Node.js server to handle form submissions.
         Validated user input and stored it in the MongoDB database.
 Displaying User Information:
         Created a page to display user information.
         Used Node.js to retrieve user data from the MongoDB database.
